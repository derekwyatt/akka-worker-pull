<h2>Balancing Workload Across Nodes with Akka 2</h2>
<p>In Akka 2, there is a nifty little thing called the <a
  href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/dispatchers.html#Types_of_dispatchers">BalancingDispatcher</a>,
which will magically distribute work to a collection of Actors in the most
efficient way possible (i.e. it's a <i>work stealing</i> dispatcher).  The <a
  href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/routing.html#SmallestMailboxRouter">SmallestMailboxRouter</a>
has this kind of feel as well.  However, the <code>BalancingDispatcher</code>
and the <code>SmallestMailboxRouter</code> differ in how the choice is made
about who, and when to deliver the incoming message.  The
<code>BalancingDispatcher</code> dispatches a message to an Actor only when that
Actor would otherwise be idle. The <code>SmallestMailboxRouter</code> dispatches
the message to the Actor with the least number of messages in its Mailbox even
while the Actor is currently working on other things.</p>

<p>Often times, people want the functionality of the
<code>BalancingDispatcher</code> with the stipulation that the Actors doing the
work have distinct Mailboxes on remote nodes.  In this post we'll explore the
implementation of such a concept.</p>

<p>I'm going to assume you understand Akka to a reasonably competent level.
Most people don't get to the point of asking how to do something like this
without understanding a fair bit about Akka in the first place, so I'm going to
pretend that my assumption is reasonable. :)</p>

<h3>The <code>BalancingDispatcher</code></h3>
<p>First, take a quick look at the <code>BalancingDispatcher</code>.
Essentially, it works by sharing a single Mailbox amongst all of its Actors.  It
doesn't really "steal" work from its Actors; it just intelligently distributes
that work by ensuring that the next message gets sent to an idle Actor, and if
one isn't available, then the message doesn't get sent until that changes.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <!--<img src="BalancingDispatcher.png"/>-->

  <div style="padding: 0.5em 30px 0.5em 30px; font-size: 80%; text-align: left;">
    <b>Fig 1</b>: The <code>BalancingDispatcher</code> distributes work to Actors evenly by
    having them all share the same Mailbox.
  </div>
</div>

<h3>The <code>SmallestMailboxRouter</code></h3>
<p>The <code>SmallestMailboxRouter</code> differs because the Actors to which it
routes all have distinct Mailboxes.  So, while the
<code>BalancingDispatcher</code> makes its decision on which Actor gets the
message at message <i>processing</i> time, the
<code>SmallestMailboxRouter</code> makes its decision on which Actor gets the
message at message <i>delivery</i> time.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <!--<img src="SmallestMailboxRouter.png" style="text-align: center;"/>-->
  <img src="http://www.derekwyatt.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/SmallestMailboxRouter.png" style="text-align: center;"/>
  <div style="padding: 0.5em 30px 0.5em 30px; font-size: 80%; text-align: left;">
    <b>Fig 2</b>: The <code>SmallestMailboxRouter</code> sends messages to Actors immediately,
    regardless as to how much time they may send working on their messages in the
    future.  The key is that it sends the message to the Actor with the smallest
    Mailbox.
  </div>
</div>

<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>We're going to rely on two key components: the <i>Master</i> and
<i>Worker</i>.  The Master will help coordinate the work and the Worker will
execute on that work.  The qualities of the pattern are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Implement the fundamental concept of the <code>BalancingDispatcher</code> -
that which distributes work only to those that can work on it immediately -
while still having distinct Mailboxes per Worker.
<ul>
  <li>We must have distinct Mailboxes per Worker since the Workers are on remote
  nodes and if they didn't have Mailboxes then there would be nowhere to deliver
  their messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Preserve the original sender of the work.  This allows the Worker to respond
to the original sender when the work is complete.</li>
<li>Provide a mechanism for the Master to detect death of a Worker and reassign
the work if need be.</li>
<li>Allow the capacity of the system to increase by the addition of Workers
dynamically.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The Pattern Overview</h3>
<p>In order to deliver on our goal we are going to invert the work-sending
paradigm of the <code>BalancingDispatcher</code>.  The Master will not
<i>push</i> work to the Workers; instead, the Workers will <i>pull</i> that work
from the Master on-demand.  There are a number of advantages to inverting this
message flow, as we'll see.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <!--<img src="FullSpread.png"/>-->
  <img src="http://www.derekwyatt.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/FullSpread.png"/>
  <div style="padding: 0.5em 30px 0.5em 30px; font-size: 80%; text-align: left;">
    <b>Fig 3</b>: Ultimately this is what we're going to achieve.  The Master
    distributes work to Workers only when Workers request it.  The Workers will
    inform the Master that they're finished their work, but the Master will not
    push work their way until they make another request.
  </div>
</div>

<p>One of the key points to remember about this pattern is that it's entirely
event driven with no polling.  Message number 2 might make it look like there is
polling, but you can rest assured that it isn't - message number 2 is sent as
the result of a previous event, not a timer.</p>

<h2>The Master and its Workers</h2>
<p>In order for the pattern to be valid we must have concrete instances of
the Master (on some node) and the Workers (on the same node, or other nodes).
The relationship between the two is key: Workers identify themselves to the
Master - the Master doesn't spawn Workers.  A variant on this pattern would be
to have the Master do exactly that, but this definition does not include that
notion.</p>

<p>The caveat, therefore, is that the Master must be running before the Workers
try to register with it, and the Workers must be aware of the Master's
location.  Another variant could use failure / retry handling in the Workers to
ease the need for this startup ordering, but that's a detail we're not concerned
with here.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <!--<img src="WorkStealingAdvertise.png"/>-->
  <img src="http://www.derekwyatt.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/WorkStealingAdvertise.png"/>
  <div style="padding: 0.5em 30px 0.5em 30px; font-size: 80%; text-align: left;">
    <b>Fig 4</b>: The Master only learns of the existence of the Workers when
    they advertise themselves.
  </div>
</div>

<p>This constraint opens up the flexibility of the system:</p>

<ul>
<li>There's no clunky configuration of the Master required.  We don't need to
"reconfigure it" every time we want to add a new Worker.</li>
<li>You can increase capacity dynamically.  If you need more Workers, just
instantiate them and they'll get work assigned to them as soon as it becomes
available.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is essentially how <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</a>'s
MapReduce system works, and it's the same way many systems before it have worked
as well.</p>

<h2>The Master</h2>
<p>Now that we know what the pattern looks like we can describe the operation of
the Master.  For the most part, our Master will take on the role of the
<code>BalancingDispatcher</code>'s single Mailbox.  It will collect up work to
be done, and distribute it as required amongst the Workers, but only at the
moment when those Workers can actually work on it.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <!--<img src="WorkStealing.png"/>-->
  <img src="http://www.derekwyatt.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/WorkStealing.png"/>
  <div style="padding: 0.5em 30px 0.5em 30px; font-size: 80%; text-align: left;">
    <b>Fig 5</b>: The Master sends work to Workers only when they ask for it.
    Workers are not polling for work - they ask for it when they're finished
    doing their current job, or they've been told that pending work is
    available.
  </div>
</div>

<p>Above we see that "Worker 3" is in a position to ask for work, while the
others are busy.  The Master will give that work out to "Worker 3" and hold on
to the rest, waiting until another Worker (or it may actually end up being
"Worker 3" again) asks for work.</p>

<h3>The Protocol</h3>
<p>We start with the message protocol that passes between the Master and its
Workers.  The following defines both messages sent to and messages sent from the
Master.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3288134.js?file=MasterProtocol.scala"></script>

<h3>The Master Code</h3>
<p>Next we see the master code.  Its job is to queue work sent to it from the
outside world, and handle the three messages that can be sent from the Workers.
It also puts Deathwatch on the Workers in order to take action should any of
those Workers croak.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3288146.js?file=Master.scala"></script>

<h2>The Worker</h2>
<p>The Worker's job is to switch between two states: <i>idle</i> and
<i>working</i>.  When it's idle, it's looking for work and when it's working
it's trying to go idle.  The Worker responds to messages differently depending
on what state it's currently in.</p>

<p>We implement the Worker as an abstract base class, from which you would
derive and implement the <code>doWork()</code> method.  It's intended that this
<code>doWork()</code> method do its job asynchronously but that's not a
requirement.  However, given how simple it is to spawn of work in a Future with
Akka, why wouldn't you?</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3288156.js?file=Worker.scala"></script>

<h3>Implementing a Worker</h3>
<p>In order to use the Worker, we need to create a derivation.  For the purposes
of this example, and testing, we're going to create a Worker that sends a string
to the original work requester.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3288187.js?file=TestWorker.scala"></script>

<p>Note how we've spawned the work off into its own Future that will execute
asynchronously.  When it's complete it will inform the Worker of that fact using
the WorkComplete message.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <!--<img src="WorkStealing.png"/>-->
  <img src="http://www.derekwyatt.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/FutureSpawn.png"/>
  <div style="padding: 0.5em 30px 0.5em 30px; font-size: 80%; text-align: left;">
    <b>Fig 6</b>: This is really how you should implement your
    <code>doWork()</code> method.  Send the work off to the future, which will
    allow your Worker to remain responsive to the Master.
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>And we now verify that everything works by implementing a test.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3288247.js?file=TestWorkerTest.scala"></script>

<h3>Possible Extensions / Modifications</h3>
<p>What's been presented is merely a pattern as instruction on the mechanism for
achieving a <code>BalancingDispatcher</code>-style work distribution system
across multiple nodes.  There are a number of variants you could make of this
pattern.</p>

<ul>
<li>Forget the whole "idle" thing.  When a Worker sees that there's no more work
to be done, it can stop itself (i.e. <code>context.stop(self)</code>).  Given
the current implementation, the Master would detect this and remove it from the
list of possible candidates.</li>
<li>Remove the side-effects.  Have a tighter relationship between the Master and
its Workers; the Worker pulls work from the Master and actually returns results
back to the Master.  Personally I can't see a reason to do this.</li>
<li>Have the Master spawn the children as needed.  This would create them as
direct children, which is certainly different than what we have here but if
that's what you want to do then do it.  The <i>pull</i> semantics don't change,
however.  You still pull - you just create the Worker as part of the Master
logic.</li>
<li>Any retry-logic that you might want would have to live in the Master, but
idempotency and retry are way beyond the scope of this article.  You can
implement retry in the Master and / or dovetail this concept into the <a
  href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/cluster/cluster.html">Clustering</a>
features that are coming up in the 2.x stream of Akka.</li>
<li>If you're smart, and implement <code>doWork()</code> in the future, then you
can have the Worker be responsive to the Master's requests for status (for
example).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage Example</h3>
<p>Let's take a different look at how you might use this, just to illustrate
that it's still a very general implementation.  If you want to download a ton of
pages in parallel across a huge farm of nodes, collect them up, and then dump
them to third party (say, a page renderer) when they're all in... <i>piece of
cake</i>.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3288756.js?file=FutureSequence.scala"></script>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The key to this pattern isn't the implementation or anything fancy. What's
important is the inversion of what, for some, is their natural inclination.
When people think of an on-demand, event-based system, they think <i>push</i>,
but push doesn't work here.  You can't push to an Actor unless you know it will
be available to do your work, and since you can't peek into its Mailbox, you're
not going to be able to find out.</p>

<p>Alternatively you might think of implementing a model where the Master can
ask the Worker what it's doing and push work it's way when it says it's idle.
This is a bad idea for a couple of reasons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>What if the Worker says "I'm busy, leave me alone"?  When can the Master
  ask again?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>It's starting to look like polling, and polling is going to slow things
    down a lot.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>What if the Worker says "I'm idle", but one millisecond later it becomes
  busy?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>The Master will send it work to do, and it won't do that work for
    (possibly) a very long time.</li>
  </ul>
</ol>

<p>You can try to work around those issues by setting up some sort of
transactional nature between the Master and the Worker - something like, "If
you're not busy, tell me you won't do anything else until I send you something".
But why?  Invert from push to pull, and none of these problems exist.  With
pull, you could even have a single Worker service many Masters without conflict,
should you choose to do so.</p>

<p>The bones of this pattern should give you highly reactive, fast, and
efficient use of your Workers across multiple nodes.  Implement and alter to
suit your needs, and then collect your profit!</p>
